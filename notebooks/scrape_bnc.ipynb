       " 'When polymers are irradiated by a beam of X-rays, scattering produces diffuse haloes on the photographic plate for some polymers, while for others a series of sharply defined rings superimposed on a diffuse background is recorded.',\n",
       " 'The former are characteristic of amorphous polymers, and illustrate that a limited amount of short range order exists in most polymeric solids.',\n",
       " 'The latter patterns are indicative of considerable three-dimensional order and are typical of polycrystalline samples containing a large number of unoriented crystallites associated with amorphous regions.',\n",
       " 'The rings are observed to sharpen into arcs, or discrete spots, if the polymer is drawn or stretched, a process which orients the axes of the crystallites in one direction.',\n",
       " 'The occurrence of significant crystallinity in a polymer sample is of considerable consequence to a materials scientist.',\n",
       " 'However, a polymer sample is rarely completely crystalline and the properties also depend on the amount of crystalline order.',\n",
       " 'It is important then to examine crystallinity in polymers and determine the factors which control the extent of crystallinity.',\n",
       " 'A polymer in very dilute solution can be effectively regarded as an isolated chain whose shape is governed by short and long range inter- and intra-molecular interactions.',\n",
       " 'In the aggregated state this is no longer true, the behaviour of the chain is now influenced largely by the proximity of the neighbouring chains and the secondary valence forces which act between them.',\n",
       " 'These factors determine the orientation of chains relative to each other in the undiluted state, and this is essentially an interplay between the entropy and internal energy of the system which is expressed in the usual thermodynamic form',\n",
       " 'In the melt, polymers normally attain a state of maximum entropy consistent with a stable state of minimum free energy.',\n",
       " 'Crystallization is a process involving the orderly arrangement of chains and is consequently associated with a large negative entropy of activation.',\n",
       " 'If a favourable free energy change is to be obtained for crystallite formation, the entropy term has to be offset by a large negative energy contribution.',\n",
       " 'The alignment of polymer chains at specific distances from one another to form crystalline nuclei will be assisted when intermolecular forces are strong.',\n",
       " 'The greater this interaction between chains the more favourable will be the energy parameter and this provides some indication of the type of chain which might be expected to crystallize from the melt, viz.',\n",
       " 'Symmetrical chains which allow the regular close packing required for crystallite formation.',\n",
       " 'Chains possessing groups which encourage strong intermolecular attraction thereby stabilizing the alignment.',\n",
       " 'In addition to the thermodynamic requirements, kinetic factors relating to the flexibility and mobility of a chain in the melt must also be considered.',\n",
       " 'Thus polyisobutylene might be expected to crystallize because the chain is symmetrical, but it will only do so if maintained at an optimum temperature for several months.',\n",
       " 'This is presumably a result of the flexibility of the chain which allows extensive convolution thereby impeding stabilization of the required long range alignment.',\n",
       " 'The creation of a three-dimensional ordered phase from a disordered state is a two stage process.',\n",
       " 'Just above its melting temperature a polymer behaves like a highly viscous liquid in which the chains are all tangled up with their neighbours.',\n",
       " 'Each chain pervades a given volume in the sample, but as the temperature decreases the volume available to the molecule also decreases.',\n",
       " 'This in turn restricts the number of disordered conformational states available to the chain due to the constraining influence of intramolecular interactions among chains in juxtaposition.',\n",
       " 'As a result there is an increasing tendency for the polymer to assume an ordered conformation in which the chain bonds are in the rotational states of lowest energy.']"
